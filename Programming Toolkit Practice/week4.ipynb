    "# Week 4: Strings of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, the word \"string\" is used to refer to text stored and manipulated by the program. Logically, strings are sequences of individual characters; Python lets you iterate over a string's characters or index them as if the string were a list of characters. The notion of character is general - it could be any letter in the alphabet, a digit, or any Unicode character, including emojis. As of Python 3, strings default to supporting Unicode, so one string could simultaneously have an English word, a math formula, and Chinese characters without making any special effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "String support is ubiquitous across programming languages. The features of strings vary from language to language, but broadly cover reading and writing raw data from files, converting that raw data into more useful forms like numbers, and converting useful data like numbers back to strings for storage. We will cover Python's string support with a focus on converting between different forms of data.\n",

    "In practice, you will not need to write your own code parsing numeric types like integers and floating point numbers, but you may need to write code separating out those numbers. In this lesson, you will see a video showing how to parse an integer, but generally, you should just use the built-in functions `int` or `float`, depending on what type of number you expect. However, you will almost inevitably run into examples where something unexpected is presented as a \"number\", and suddenly an exception will happen. So, we will also show you how to catch exceptions and deal with them. We will not cover how you should respond to invalid numbers; that will depend on your application. But you will be able to handle them as you see fit.\n",

Both are reasonable bases for future development depending on your specific needs.\n",

    "The idea of TSV files is simple. Each line in the file is broken up into columns by a \"tab\" character (\"\\t\" in Python and most languages). This works because most data does not naturally have embedded tabs. After reading each line, simply split it on tabs and you have the columns.\n",

Each line except the last one will end with the newline character, but it is not really data, just a separator between lines.\n",
    "- The string method `str.split` breaks up the original string and returns the pieces in a list. The original string is not actually changed.\n",
    "- Sometimes functions like this are written to return tuples of data to discourage accidental changes. This requires marginal extra code - just add `tuple()` to the `yield` statement. However, this makes changes like parsing numbers from strings more inconvenient, so its probably better to leave it as a list.\n",
    "- All the values in the returned rows will be strings. You will eventually want to convert them to other types.\n",
    "- This code is unlikely to have errors if the file exists and you can read it, but unexpected results may happen if the columns are inconsistent.\n",

    "- The nested function `parse_line` is for convenience to avoid repeating the logic for stripping newlines and splitting on tabs. It does not access any variables from the surrounding scope, but itself is scoped so only code inside the with statement can access it.\n",
    "- The header variable is a list populated by parsing the first line of the file.\n",
    "- This function uses three built-in functions that we haven't mentioned before.\n",
    "    - The built-in function `next` returns the next output from an iterator. In this case, it was the first line from the file.\n",
    "     - The built-in function `dict` takes in an iterable of pairs (sequences of length two) and populates a dictionary. The first value of each pair becomes a key, and the second value of each pair is that key's value.\n",
    "    - The built-in function `zip` takes two or more iterables, repeatedly takes a value from each, and yields a tuple of those values. The name is an analogy to zipping up a zipper - two sides are becoming paired together. In this usage, the column names in the `header` variable are being paired with the values in the `line` variable.\n",
    "- This code will raise an exception when next is called if the file is empty\n",
    "    - This means that the file does not even have a header row, and your assumptions about this being a valid data file were wrong. If you catch this exception, you should probably report which file the error, and then raise an exception again since your process is unlikely to work with this file empty.\n",
    "- If rows after the header have different numbers of values, this code will continue without an exception, but you may be surprised later since the dictionaries are not as expected\n",
    "    - If there are fewer values than expected, then the code will implicitly assume that these values should be matched to the first column names in the header, and the dictionary will be missing the later keys. You will see the `KeyError` exception when trying to access those keys.\n",
    "    - If there are more values than expected, then they will be silently dropped by the `zip` function.\n",
    "    - If you want to catch these cases, you can add an explicit length comparison `(len(header) != len(line))` and code your own response, or add `strict=True` to the `zip` call which will make it raise a `ValueError` if the lengths do not match.\n",

    "The comma-separated value format, or CSV for short, is a more common file format than TSVs. Many older software systems, and Microsoft Excel in particular, used CSV files as their primary shareable file format. Like TSVs, CSVs are human readable. As you likely assumed, comma-separated value files use commas to separate values. But since commas are much more likely to appear in string data than tabs (which are invisible), CSV files use quoting and other means to distinguish commas in values and commas separating values. The details vary across software generating the files, but the Microsoft Excel dialect is close to a de facto standard.\n",

    "That example JSON data should be easy for you to interpret with your knowledge so far. In fact, this example is almost valid Python code except for the `null` at the end instead of None.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is not a great representation for data in data science. It takes up a lot of space and can be expensive to parse. However, it is still handy to know since it is often used for configuration files, and you may need to parse other data sources using JSON to extract the data that you want to model. Fortunately, Python has strong JSON support via the built-in json library.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly nice feature of JSON is that all the type information is built-in to the file format, so parsing a JSON file includes parsing all the types. A downside of JSON is that if the file is corrupted somehow, then it is difficult to recover, in contrast to TSV and CSV files where you can usually get away with just dropping the impacted lines."
